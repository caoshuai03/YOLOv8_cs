### CLA Signing

Before we can accept your pull request, you need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CLA.md). This is a legal document stating that you agree to the terms of contributing to the Ultralytics YOLO repositories. The CLA ensures that your contributions are properly licensed and that the project can continue to be distributed under the AGPL-3.0 license.

To sign the CLA, follow the instructions provided by the CLA bot after you submit your PR.

### Google-Style Docstrings

When adding new functions or classes, please include a [Google-style docstring](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) to provide clear and concise documentation for other developers. This will help ensure that your contributions are easy to understand and maintain.

Example Google-style docstring:

```python
def example_function(arg1: int, arg2: str) -> bool:
    """Example function that demonstrates Google-style docstrings.

    Args:
        arg1 (int): The first argument.
        arg2 (str): The second argument.

    Returns:
        bool: True if successful, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `arg1` is negative or `arg2` is empty.
    """
    if arg1 < 0 or not arg2:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input values")
    return True
```

### GitHub Actions CI Tests

Before your pull request can be merged, all GitHub Actions Continuous Integration (CI) tests must pass. These tests include linting, unit tests, and other checks to ensure that your changes meet the quality standards of the project. Make sure to review the output of the GitHub Actions and fix any issues
